        The shell can be defined as a command interpreter within an operating system like Linux/GNU or Unix. It is a program that runs other programs. The shell facilitates every user of the computer as an interface to the Unix/GNU Linux system. Hence, the user can execute different tools/utilities or commands with a few input data.

          The shell sends the result to the user over the screen when it has completed running a program which is the common output device. That's why it is known as "command interpreter".

                  The shell is not just a command interpreter. Also, the shell is a programming language with complete constructs of a programming language such as functions, variables, loops, conditional execution, and many others.

                  For this reason, GNU/Unix Linux Shell is stronger than the Windows shell. <br><br>

          <b> Graphical Shells </b> <br>
          These shells specifies the manipulation of programs that are based on the graphical user interface (GUI) 
          by permitting for operations like moving, closing, resizing, and opening windows and switching focus 
          among windows as well. Ubuntu OS or Windows OS could be examined as a 
          good example that offers a graphical user interface to the user to interact with the program. 
          Various users don't need for typing in any command for all the actions.
          <br><br>

          <b>  Command-line Shell </b>   
          Various shells could be accessed with the help of a command-line interface by users. 
          A unique program known as Command prompt in Windows or Terminal in macOS/Linux is offered 
          for typing in the human-understandable commands like "ls", "cat", etc and after that, it is being run.
          The result is further shown to the user on the terminal.

          Working on a command-line shell is a complicated for many beginners due to it is hard to remember 
          several commands. Command-line shell is very dominant and it permits users for storing commands in 
          a file and run them together. In this way, a repetitive action could be automated easily. Usually,
          these files are known as Shell scripts in macOS/Linux systems and batch files in Windows. <br>

          There are various types of shells which are discussed as follows: <br> <br>

          <b> Bash Shell : </b> <br> 
          In the bash shell, bash means Bourne Again Shell. It is a default shell over several distributions of Linux 
          today. It is a sh-compatible shell. It could be installed over Windows OS. 
          It facilitates practical improvements on sh for interactive and programming use which contains: 

          <ol>
              <li> Job Control </li>
              <li> Command-line editing </li>
              <li> Shell Aliases and Functions </li>
              <li> Unlimited size command history </li>
              <li> Integer arithmetic in a base from 2-64 </li>
          </ol>
          <br>

          <b> Csh/Tcsh Shell : </b> <br> 
          Tcsh is an upgraded C shell. This shell can be used as a shell script command processor and interactive 
          login shell.
          Tcsh shell includes the following characteristics: 

          C like syntax
          <ol>
              <li> Filename completion and programmable word </li>
              <li> Command-line editor </li>
              <li> Job control </li>
              <li> Spelling correction </li>
          </ol> 

          <b> Ksh Shell : </b> <br>
          Ksh means for Korn shell. It was developed and designed by David G. Korn. Ksh shell is a high-level,
          powerful, and complete programming language and it is a reciprocal command language as well just like 
          various other GNU/Unix Linux shells. The usage and syntax of the C shell are very same as the 
          C programming language. <br> <br>

         <b> Zsh Shell : </b> 
          Zsh shell is developed to be reciprocal and it combines various aspects of other GNU/Unix Linux shells 
          like ksh, tcsh, and bash. Also, the POSIX shell standard specifications were based on the Korn shell.
          Also, it is a strong scripting language like other available shells. Some of its unique features are 
          listed as follows:

          <ol>
             <li> Startup files </li> 
             <li> Filename generation </li> 
             <li> Login/Logout watching </li> 
             <li> Concept index </li> 
             <li> Closing comments </li> 
             <li> Variable index </li> 
             <li> Key index </li>
             <li> Function index and various others that we could find out within the man pages. </li></ol> 
          All these shells do a similar job but take different commands and facilitate distinct 
          built-in functions. <br> <br>
          
          <b> Fish : </b> <br> 
          Fish stands for "friendly interactive shell". It was produced in 2005. Fish shell was developed to be 
          fully user-friendly and interactive just like other shells. It contains some good features which are 
          mentioned below:
          <ol>
            <li> Web-based configuration </li> 
            <li> Man page completions </li>
            <li> Auto-suggestions </li>
            <li> Support for term256 terminal automation </li>
            <li> Completely scripted with clean scripts </li> 
          </ol>
          
         <b> Shell Prompt : </b><br> 
        It is known as a command prompt and it is issued via the shell. We can type any command while the prompt 
        is shown.
        Shell reads our input after we click Enter. It illustrates the command we want to be run by seeing at 
        the initial word of our input. A word can be defined as the character's unbroken set. 
        Tabs and spaces separate words.
        The below is a common data command example that shows the current time and date:
        We can also customize our command prompt with the help of PS1 (environment variable). <br><br>

        <b> Shell Scripting : </b> <br>
        The common concept of the shell script is the command list. A good shell script will contain comments 
        which are preceded via # simbol.Shell functions and scripts are interpreted. It means they aren't compiled.
        There are also conditional tests like value Y is greater than value Z, loops permitting us to proceed by 
        massive data amounts, files to store and read data, and variables to store and read data, and these scripts
        may contain functions.
        The shells are usually interactive which means they receive commands as input through the users and run 
        them. Although sometimes we routinely wish to run a set of commands, hence, we have to type within the 
        commands all-time inside the terminal. <br>
